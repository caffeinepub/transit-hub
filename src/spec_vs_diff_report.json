  "summary": "The diff implements backend and frontend infrastructure for handling rate breakdowns (base fare, taxes, service fees) across the application. The implementation covers REQ-1 (backend storage), REQ-2 (search results display with fare breakdown), and REQ-3 (admin table display with rate breakdown). All three requirements appear to be addressed with appropriate data structures, UI components, and fare calculation logic.",
