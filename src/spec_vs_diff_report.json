  "summary": "The diff shows backend and frontend infrastructure changes to support fare breakdown (baseFare, taxes, serviceFees) and rate management, but does NOT contain actual real city names or real-world pricing data from RedBus or other booking platforms. All requirements remain unimplemented as the code only provides the structure to store such data, not the data itself.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace placeholder city names with real city data from RedBus or similar booking platforms for all transport types",
      "reason": "No evidence of real city names being added. The backend schema supports city storage (origin/destination fields exist), but no actual city data from RedBus, MakeMyTrip, or Goibibo is present in the diff.",

      "reason": "No real taxi pricing data from Ola, Uber, or local taxi services is present. The vehicle multiplier logic exists but uses arbitrary values (1.5x for SUV, 2x for van) rather than actual market rates.",
