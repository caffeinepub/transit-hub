# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display Red Bus routes and their complete fare breakdown throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Ensure Red Bus routes with transport type 'bus' are stored in backend with complete fare breakdown (base fare, taxes, service fees)
- Display Red Bus routes in search results page with correct total fare and itemized pricing breakdown
- Show Red Bus routes in AdminRoutesTable with full rate breakdown details visible

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view Red Bus routes in search results with accurate fare information, and administrators can see and manage Red Bus routes with complete pricing details in the admin panel.
