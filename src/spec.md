# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace placeholder data with real city names and realistic pricing from RedBus and other booking platforms across all transport types.

**Planned changes:**
- Update backend to use real city names from booking platforms (RedBus, MakeMyTrip, Goibibo) for bus, train, and taxi routes
- Replace bus route pricing with realistic RedBus fare structures including base fare, taxes, and service fees
- Update train route pricing to reflect real-world fare data from IRCTC/MakeMyTrip
- Update taxi pricing model to match real market rates from Ola/Uber based on distance and vehicle type
- Ensure all frontend displays show updated real city names and accurate pricing across route cards, detail pages, booking summaries, and admin tables

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see realistic city names and accurate market-based pricing for all bus, train, and taxi routes throughout the application, making the booking experience more authentic and trustworthy.
