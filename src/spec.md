## Summary
**Goal:** Add real city routes and fare data from competitor research to expand available booking options.

**Planned changes:**
- Research and add 20-30 realistic city pairs covering major Indian cities (Delhi-Mumbai, Bangalore-Chennai, Kolkata-Hyderabad, etc.)
- Add competitive fare data for train, bus, and taxi options based on current market rates from sites like RedBus, MakeMyTrip, and Goibibo
- Update backend Route data initialization in main.mo with realistic schedules, operator names, departure/arrival times, duration, and pricing
- Ensure search functionality displays new routes correctly with accurate fare information

**User-visible outcome:** Users can search and book travel between 20-30 major Indian city pairs with realistic fares across multiple transport modes (train, bus, taxi).
